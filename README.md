   cd openfront
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   # Required - Database Connection
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/openfront"
   
   # Required - Session Security (must be at least 32 characters)
   SESSION_SECRET="your-very-long-session-secret-key-here-32-chars-minimum"
   
   # Optional - Payment Providers (Stripe)
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_51..."
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
   
   # Optional - Payment Providers (PayPal)
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID="your-paypal-client-id"
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET="your-paypal-client-secret"
   
   # Optional - Shipping Provider (Shippo)
   SHIPPO_API_KEY="shippo_test_..."
   
   # Optional - File Storage (S3-compatible)
   S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-bucket-name"
   S3_REGION="us-east-1"
   S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
   S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
   
   # Optional - Email Configuration
   SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
   SMTP_PORT="587"
   SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
   SMTP_PASS="your-app-password"
   FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourstore.com"
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Build KeystoneJS schema
   - Run database migrations
   - Start Next.js development server with Turbopack

4. **Access the application:**
   - **Storefront**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Customer-facing store
   - **Admin Panel**: [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) - Management interface
   - **GraphQL API**: [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql) - Interactive API explorer

5. **Create your first admin user:**
   On first visit to the admin panel, you'll be prompted to create an admin user account at `/dashboard/init`

6. **Run store onboarding:**
   After creating your admin account, use the onboarding process to set up your store with sample data

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Build Keystone + migrate + start Next.js dev server
- `npm run build` - Build Keystone + migrate + build Next.js for production
- `npm run migrate:gen` - Generate and apply new database migrations
- `npm run migrate` - Deploy existing migrations to database
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Payment Integration
Configure payment providers using the adapter pattern:

```typescript
// Payment provider integration
const paymentResult = await paymentProviderAdapter.createPaymentFunction({
  cart,
  amount: cart.total,
  currency: cart.currency.code,
  customer: cart.customer
});
```

### Shipping Integration
Set up shipping providers with flexible adapter system:

```typescript
// Shipping provider integration
const rates = await shippingProviderAdapter.getRatesFunction({
  provider,
  fromAddress: warehouse.address,
  toAddress: order.shippingAddress,
  packages: order.packages
});
```
